    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic mortality has been a public health issue in the United States, with thousands of individuals dying each year due to various factors contributing to road accidents. This project aims to identify the leading causes of traffic fatalities and recommend effective strategies to reduce the number of deaths on American roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will examine the leading contributors to traffic fatalities, including speeding, drunk driving, and distracted driving. Speeding remains one of the most significant factors, as higher speeds reduce the driver’s ability to react to sudden changes and increase the severity of accidents. Drunk driving is another major cause, with impaired judgment and delayed reaction times leading to a higher likelihood of crashes. Distracted driving, often due to mobile phone use or other in-vehicle distractions, has also emerged as a critical concern in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The project also aims to answer the following questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* How has the total number of traffic fatalities changed over the past years?\n",
    "* What are the age and gender distributions of traffic mortality victims?\n",
    "* How does traffic mortality vary by state or region?\n",
    "* Do the number of fatalities correlates with the population of regions?\n",
    "* How does the fatality rate varies between rural and urban areas?\n",
    "* What are the leading causes of traffic fatalities in the USA in 2022?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer all these questions, we are making use of Tableau desktop (for data visualization and also to create our report) and Bigquery (to create our database and store all the tables we are using)."

The data is comprised of 33 tables. However, 8 tables were used to answer our questions. Before doing our analysis, the data had to go through a cleaning process where the necessary number of columns were selected from every table."

    "In 2010, the total number of road fatalities stood at 32,999. This figure remained relatively stable over the next few years, with minor fluctuations observed until 2014. This stability suggests that existing road safety measures during this period were relatively effective in maintaining a consistent number of fatalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from 2015, there is a noticeable and steady increase in the number of road fatalities. This upward trend continues, reaching its peak in 2021 with a total of 43,230 fatalities. The increase during this period raises significant concerns about the effectiveness of road safety policies and the potential impact of other factors such as increased vehicle usage, distracted driving, or infrastructure issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, there is a slight decrease in road fatalities to 42,514, down from the peak observed in the previous year. While this reduction is a positive sign, the overall number of fatalities remains high, indicating that further measures are necessary to achieve a more substantial and sustained decrease.\n",

    "The trend in US road fatalities from 2010 to 2022 highlights both periods of stability and significant increases, culminating in a peak in 2021. Despite a slight reduction in 2022, the overall trend underscores the critical need for comprehensive and proactive approaches to road safety to protect lives and reduce the number of fatalities on US roads."
