## **1. Introduction**

Traffic mortality has been a public health issue in the United States, with thousands of individuals dying each year due to various factors contributing to road accidents. This project aims to identify the leading causes of traffic fatalities and recommend effective strategies to reduce the number of deaths on American roads.

The project will examine the leading contributors to traffic fatalities, including speeding, drunk driving, and distracted driving. Speeding remains one of the most significant factors, as higher speeds reduce the driverâ€™s ability to react to sudden changes and increase the severity of accidents. Drunk driving is another major cause, with impaired judgment and delayed reaction times leading to a higher likelihood of crashes. Distracted driving, often due to mobile phone use or other in-vehicle distractions, has also emerged as a critical concern in recent years.

**The project also aims to answer the following questions:**

* How has the total number of traffic fatalities changed over the past years?
* What are the age and gender distributions of traffic mortality victims?
* How does traffic mortality vary by state or region?
* Do the number of fatalities correlates with the population of regions?
* How does the fatality rate varies between rural and urban areas?
* What are the leading causes of traffic fatalities in the USA in 2022?

To answer all these questions, we are making use of Tableau desktop (for data visualization and also to create our report) and Bigquery (to create our database and store all the tables we are using).
