    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic mortality has been a public health issue in the United States, with thousands of individuals dying each year due to various factors contributing to road accidents. This project aims to identify the leading causes of traffic fatalities and recommend effective strategies to reduce the number of deaths on American roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will examine the leading contributors to traffic fatalities, including speeding, drunk driving, and distracted driving. Speeding remains one of the most significant factors, as higher speeds reduce the driver’s ability to react to sudden changes and increase the severity of accidents. Drunk driving is another major cause, with impaired judgment and delayed reaction times leading to a higher likelihood of crashes. Distracted driving, often due to mobile phone use or other in-vehicle distractions, has also emerged as a critical concern in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The project also aims to answer the following questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* How has the total number of traffic fatalities changed over the past years?\n",
    "* What are the age and gender distributions of traffic mortality victims?\n",
    "* How does traffic mortality vary by state or region?\n",
    "* Do the number of fatalities correlates with the population of regions?\n",
    "* How does the fatality rate varies between rural and urban areas?\n",
    "* What are the leading causes of traffic fatalities in the USA in 2022?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer all these questions, we are making use of Tableau desktop (for data visualization and also to create our report) and Bigquery (to create our database and store all the tables we are using)."

    "In 2010, the total number of road fatalities stood at 32,999. This figure remained relatively stable over the next few years, with minor fluctuations observed until 2014. This stability suggests that existing road safety measures during this period were relatively effective in maintaining a consistent number of fatalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from 2015, there is a noticeable and steady increase in the number of road fatalities. This upward trend continues, reaching its peak in 2021 with a total of 43,230 fatalities. The increase during this period raises significant concerns about the effectiveness of road safety policies and the potential impact of other factors such as increased vehicle usage, distracted driving, or infrastructure issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, there is a slight decrease in road fatalities to 42,514, down from the peak observed in the previous year. While this reduction is a positive sign, the overall number of fatalities remains high, indicating that further measures are necessary to achieve a more substantial and sustained decrease.\n",

    "Distracted driving is another prevalent issue, with inattention being the leading cause of fatalities, resulting in 1,421 deaths. General distraction, whether from mobile phones, other occupants, or external factors, contributes to an additional 495 fatalities. The data further breaks down the distractions, with mobile phone usage (both manipulation and other phone-related activities) accounting for significant numbers—157 and 139 fatalities respectively. These figures highlight the urgent need to address distracted driving through both technological solutions and behavioral changes. Banning the use of handheld devices while driving, promoting the use of hands-free technology, and educating drivers on the risks of distraction can help mitigate this problem. Additionally, developing and implementing in-vehicle technology to limit distractions and enhance driver focus could further reduce these fatalities."

    "\n",
    "Traffic violations are another critical factor leading to road fatalities. The data highlights that manslaughter or homicide due to traffic violations results in 1,555 deaths, while driving while intoxicated, whether due to alcohol or drugs, accounts for 1,369 fatalities. Failure to yield, inattentiveness, and improper driving practices are also major contributors, resulting in 647 and 617 fatalities respectively. These statistics point to a need for better driver education and stricter enforcement of traffic laws. Programs focusing on defensive driving, the dangers of impaired driving, and adherence to traffic regulations could significantly reduce these numbers. Furthermore, implementing advanced traffic monitoring systems and increasing the visibility of law enforcement on the roads can act as deterrents to such violations."

    "#### **Leading Drugs Involved in Accidents**\n",
    "\n",
    "Drug impairment is a major contributor to road accidents, with certain substances being more prevalent in these incidents. The data reveals that Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component in marijuana, tops the list with 7,204 cases, followed closely by its metabolite, 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Carboxy THC), at 6,259 cases. Stimulants like amphetamine and methamphetamine are also significant contributors, involved in 5,197 and 5,171 accidents respectively. The presence of various forms of THC and other cannabinoids underscores the impact of marijuana on driving capabilities. Additionally, substances such as caffeine, fentanyl, and cocaine, though less prevalent, still pose substantial risks. Addressing the issue of drug-impaired driving requires a multi-faceted approach, including public awareness campaigns, stricter regulations, and enhanced enforcement measures to detect and deter drug use among drivers."

    "Speeding is yet another leading cause of road fatalities, with 30.30% of fatal accidents involving speeding. High speeds reduce the driver's reaction time and increase the severity of crashes. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach. Law enforcement can play a crucial role by strictly monitoring and penalizing speeding violations. Moreover, educating drivers about the dangers of speeding and encouraging safer driving habits through public service announcements and community programs can create a cultural shift towards safer driving behaviors. Advanced technologies, such as speed cameras and intelligent speed adaptation systems in vehicles, can also help in reducing speeding-related fatalities."

This statistic is alarming and underscores the need for stringent measures to combat impaired driving.

Additionally, promoting the use of alternative transportation options, like rideshares and public transport, can help keep impaired individuals off the roads."

In contrast, roads with a divided, unprotected median follow with 8,859 fatalities, while those with a positive median barrier report significantly fewer fatalities, at 5,923. The presence of medians, particularly those that are positive and robust, clearly mitigates the risk of fatal accidents. Therefore, enhancing road infrastructure by installing or upgrading median barriers on major roadways could considerably reduce fatalities."

The chart shows that the number of fatalities is lower during the early morning hours but starts increasing significantly from around 3 PM, peaking between 6 PM and 8 PM. This trend aligns with the evening rush hour when traffic density is high, and drivers may be fatigued or rushing home. To counter this, implementing measures such as stricter speed limits, better lighting, and heightened police presence during these critical hours could prove effective in reducing the number of fatalities."
