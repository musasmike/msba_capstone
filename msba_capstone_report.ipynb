This project aims to identify the leading causes of traffic fatalities and recommend effective strategies to reduce the number of deaths on American roads.\n",

                "The project will examine the leading contributors to traffic fatalities, including speeding, drunk driving, and distracted driving. Speeding remains one of the most significant factors, as higher speeds reduce the driver’s ability to react to sudden changes and increase the severity of accidents. Drunk driving is another major cause, with impaired judgment and delayed reaction times leading to a higher likelihood of crashes. Distracted driving, often due to mobile phone use or other in-vehicle distractions, has also emerged as a critical concern in recent years.\n",
